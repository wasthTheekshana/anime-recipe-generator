# Research Paper Summarizer â€“ Project Planning

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview
A web application that uses NLP and citation graph analysis to automatically summarize academic papers, extract key citations, and support research comprehension.

---

## ðŸ§­ High-Level Goals
- Upload or link a research paper (PDF, arXiv, PubMed)
- Generate a TL;DR summary (1-liner, bullet, paragraph)
- Extract and visualize citation relationships
- Allow Q&A interaction with paper content
- Enable semantic similarity and paper recommendations
- Support export (Markdown, Zotero)

---

## ðŸ§± MVP Scope

### Must-Have (MVP)
- Upload a PDF and extract full text
- Summarize the paper using a pre-trained model
- Extract references and render a citation graph
- Basic frontend UI for upload + summary + graph
- Export summary as text

### Nice-to-Have (Post-MVP)
- Q&A chatbot for paper content
- Semantic paper search (via embeddings)
- Multilingual summary support (mT5)
- User accounts and saved history
- Notion/Zotero export integration

## ðŸš§ Architectural Notes
- Use RESTful endpoints: `/summarize`, `/upload`, `/citations`, `/qa`
- Models abstracted into `services/` folder in backend
- Consider caching results for repeated papers
